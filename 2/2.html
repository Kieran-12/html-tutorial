        Images really spice up your website, providing visual detail to what
        your website is trying to do. But how do you insert a picture?<br />You
        can insert a picture by using the &lt;img&gt; tag. When nothing is
        inside it, it will look like this:
      </p>
      <p class="special">&lt;img src="" alt="" width="" height=""&gt;</p>
      <p>
        By default, the 'width' and 'height' parts won't be there, although they
        are still important to define the size of the image on the website. The
        computer reads width="100"&nbsp;height="150" as the width=100 pixels and
        height=150 pixels and the height is 150 pixels. Inside 'alt', short for
        'alternative text', you can write text that replaces the image in case
        the image cannot load. It is useful to write text to describe the image,
        which will provide the reader with the necessary information that the
        image would have otherwise provided. Inside 'src' short for 'source' is
        where the image can be found. Usually, you have to move around inside
        the folder to find the image. For example:
      </p>
      <p class="special">
        &lt;img src="../images/youtube_logo.jpg" alt="YouTube Logo"&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
        The '..' part is important as it tells the computer to exit the current
        location and start searching from there. Your folders may be arranged in
        a different way so your code may look a little different. Just make sure
        you remember that you always start from wherever the code is actually
        written. An easier way to understand this is let's say this html code is
        in a folder called 'html' and the image is in a seperate folder called
        'images'. To get to this picture, we must exit 'html' through '..' then
        enter images through '/images' then access the image through
        '/youtube_logo.jpg'. This is what the code looks like:
      </p>
      <img
        src="../images/youtube_logo.jpg"
        alt="YouTube Logo"
        width="180"
        height="120"
      />
      <p>
        The picture you can see is 180 pixels wide and 120 pixels high. It's
        alternative text is 'YouTube Logo'
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 id="section-links" class="subheading">Links:</h2>
      <p>
        To put a link on the website, you can use the &lt;a&gt; tag. For
        example, if we want the link to send the user to the website
        'https://www.youtube.com/', we can write the code in the 'href' part.
        Below is the code.
      </p>
      <p class="special">
        &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/"&gt;YouTube Link&lt;/a&gt;
      </p>
      <p>The link below opens a new YouTube tab:</p>
      <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube Link</a>
      <p>
        These are called hyperlinks. You may have seen a lot of these on
        Wikipedia. When clicked, they send you to a different website.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also use an image as a link. It's the same as a normal text
        hyperlink, where when you click on the picture, it will send you to a
        different website. For example:
      </p>
      <p class="special">
        &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/"&gt;&lt;img src="youtube_logo.jpg"
        alt="YouTube Logo" width="180" height="120"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
        We utilise the image from before. When used, the output looks like this:
      </p>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/"
        ><img src=../images/youtube_logo.jpg alt="YouTube Logo" width="180"
        height="120"></a
      >
      <p>Try clicking on it.</p>
      <p>
        You can see that it looks the same as the picture in the Images section,
        but it actually serves another purpose, which is to act as a link as
        well.
